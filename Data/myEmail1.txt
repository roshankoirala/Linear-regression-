Share your views and experiences with us

Dear Researcher, 
Growing emphasis on readership and impact is leading researchers to communicate about their work in new ways, to new audiences, from much earlier in the research process. With the support of AIP Publishing and some other publishers, Kudos is leading a study to understand these changes, with a view to providing better support and services. 
We invite you to take 10 minutes to share your views and experiences with us via an online survey. Survey participants will be entered into a prize drawing for online shopping vouchers. The prize value is £100 (or the equivalent in local currency, where possible). The survey is open until March 31st, 2019. 
To participate in the survey and enter the prize drawing, please click the button below.

Many thanks in advance for your contribution! 

Best wishes, 
AIP Publishing and The Kudos Team.
