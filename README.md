# Linear-regression-

While learning machine learning by self study, I foud there are two great resources for the subject: 

https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

The programming assinments given in the former is in R while later is in Octave/Matlab. 
As a python user I decided to do the exercises in python. There are many topics overlapped from the two resources. 
While some of the topics are found only among one of them. So, in case of repeatation I have done only exercise from 
Andrew Ng's course. While in other case I have taken data from ISLR and done the analysis. 

While doing exercise, codes are implemented from first principle and without using any machine learning packages, wherever 
possible. After then I have solved the problem using appropriate python library. 

The topics included are 

01. Simple linear regrssion 
02. Multiple linear regression 
03. Logistic regression
04. Shrinkage method 
05. Multiclass logistic regression 
06. Neural network 
07. k-nearest neighbor 
08. Naive Bayes
09. Linear discriminant analysis 
10. Hypothesis testing 
11. Cross validation 
12. Bootstrap 
13. Subset selection 
14. Decision tree 
15. Random forest 
16. Support vector machine
17. Principle component analysis  
18. k-mean clusturing 
19. Anomaly detection 
20. Recommender system
