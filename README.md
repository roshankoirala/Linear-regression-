# Introduction  

While learning machine learning by self study, I foud there are two great resources for the subject: 

https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

The programming assinments given in the former is in R while later is in Octave/Matlab. As a python user I decided to do the exercises in python. There are many topics overlapped from the two resources. While some of the topics are found only among one of them. In this repository I have done programming assigments from the later course. While the assignments from the former courses have been solved here: https://github.com/roshankoirala/Statistical-Learning- 


While doing exercise, codes are implemented from first principle and without using any machine learning packages, wherever 
possible. After that, I have solved the problem using appropriate python library. 

The topics included are 

01. Simple Linear Regrssion (EX1)
02. Multiple Linear Regression (EX1)
03. Logistic Regression (EX2)
04. Polynomial Features & Shrinkage Method (EX2)
05. Multiclass Logistic Regression (EX3)
06. Neural Network (EX4)
07. Bias Variance Trade Off (EX5)
08. Support Vector Machine (EX6)
09. Spam filter using SVM (EX6)
10. Principle Component Analysis (EX7) 
11. k-Mean Clusturing (EX7)
12. Anomaly Detection (EX8)
13. Recommender System (EX8)

TODO:
Add a pdf file on each exercise elaborating the mathematics behind the algorithms.
