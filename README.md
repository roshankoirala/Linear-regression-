# Linear-regression-

While learning machine learning by self studying I foud there are two great resources for the subject: 

https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/

https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

The programming assinments given in the former is in R while later is in Octave/Matlab. 
As a python user I decided to do the exercises in python. There are many topics overlapped from the two resources. 
While some of the topics are found only among one of them. So, in case of repeatation I have done only exercise from 
Andrew Ng's course. While in other case I have taken data from ISLR and done the analysis. 

While doing exercise, codes are implemented from first principle and without using any machine learning packages, wherever 
possible. After then I have solved the problem using appropriate python library.
